    <h1>Fried Rice Recipe</h1>
    <img src="fried rice.jpg" alt="Fried Rice">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fried rice is a popular dish made by stir-frying cooked rice with a mixture of vegetables, protein, and seasoning. The rice is lightly fried in oil, along with ingredients like carrots, peas, bell peppers, and onions, and it is often enhanced with soy sauce and other flavorings. The dish is versatile and can be made with chicken, shrimp, or beef.

    Typically served at gatherings or as a side dish, fried rice pairs well with grilled meats or fried plantains. Its bright and colorful presentation comes from the fresh vegetables, and its slightly crispy texture is achieved by frying the rice over high heat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain cooked rice (preferably day-old)</li>
        <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, bell peppers)</li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 eggs (beaten)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ginger (minced)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked chicken, shrimp, or beef (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>Spring onions (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ingredients: Chop the vegetables and cook your choice of protein if using. Beat the eggs and set aside.</li>

        <li>Sauté the onions and garlic: In a large pan or wok, heat some vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions, garlic, and ginger, cooking until soft and fragrant.</li>

        <li>Cook the eggs: Push the onions to the side of the pan and pour in the beaten eggs. Scramble them until fully cooked, then mix them with the onions.</li>

        <li>Add the vegetables: Stir in the mixed vegetables and cook for 3-4 minutes until slightly tender.</li>

        <li>Add the rice: Increase the heat to high and add the cooked rice. Stir-fry the rice with the vegetables, making sure the grains are evenly coated with oil.</li>

        <li>Season the rice: Add soy sauce, salt, and pepper to taste. If you're using cooked chicken, shrimp, or beef, add it at this point and stir well.</li>

        <li>Fry the rice: Let the rice fry for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it starts to crisp slightly.</li>

        <li>Serve: Garnish with chopped spring onions and serve hot. Enjoy with your choice of grilled meats or plantains.</li>
