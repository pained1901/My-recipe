    <h1>Jollof rice Recipe</h1>
    <img src="jollof rice.jpg" alt="Jollof">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a popular West African dish made by cooking rice in a tomato-based sauce with onions, peppers, and spices like thyme and curry. The rice absorbs the rich flavors as it simmers in broth, often with added vegetables or meats for extra taste. Scotch bonnet peppers give it a spicy kick, and the vibrant orange color comes from tomato paste.

        Typically served at parties, jollof rice pairs well with fried plantains, chicken, or fish. Its smoky flavor comes from letting the rice form a crispy layer at the bottom of the pot, a part known as "party jollof." The dish is enjoyed across West Africa, with Nigerian and Ghanaian versions being the most famous.</p>
    <h3>Ingriedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>3-4 large tomatoes (blended)</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper (blended)    </li>
        <li>1 onion (chopped)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1-2 scotch bonnet peppers (optional, for heat)</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken or beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Vegetables like carrots, peas, or green beans (optional)</li>
        <li>Chicken, beef, or fish (optional, for serving)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes and peppers: Blend the tomatoes, red bell pepper, and scotch bonnet pepper (if using) into a smooth paste and set aside.</li>

        <li>Sauté the onions: In a large pot, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and garlic, cooking until soft and fragrant.</li>

        <li>Cook the tomato paste: Add the tomato paste to the onions and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently to avoid burning.</li>

        <li>Add the blended tomatoes: Pour in the blended tomato mixture, thyme, curry powder, and bay leaves. Simmer on medium heat for 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens and the oil starts separating from the tomato mixture.</li>

        <li>Add broth: Pour in the chicken or beef broth, stir well, and let it come to a boil.</li>

        <li>Add rice: Rinse the rice and add it to the pot. Stir to combine with the sauce, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid.</li>

        <li>Cook the rice: Let the rice simmer on low heat for about 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent it from burning. If needed, add a little water or broth to ensure the rice cooks through.</li>

        <li>Add vegetables (optional): If adding vegetables, stir them in about 10 minutes before the rice is fully cooked, so they remain slightly crunchy.</li>

        <li>Fluff and serve: Once the rice is cooked, fluff it with a fork and serve with your choice of fried plantains, grilled chicken, or fish. Enjoy!</li>
        <p>This method produces a delicious, flavorful jollof rice with a slight smokiness from the well-cooked bottom layer</p>
